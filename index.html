    <div class="box">
      <p class="para">We have been up all night, my friends and I, beneath mosque lamps whose brass cupolas are bright
        as our souls, because like them they were illuminated by the internal glow of electric hearts. And trampling
        underfoot our native sloth on opulent Persian carpets, we have been discussing right up to the limits of logic
        and scrawling the paper with demented writing.</p>
      <p class="para">Our hearts were filled with an immense pride at feeling ourselves standing quite alone, like
        lighthouses or like the sentinels in an outpost, facing the army of enemy stars encamped in their celestial
        bivouacs. Alone with the engineers in the infernal stokeholes of great ships, alone with the black spirits which
        rage in the belly of rogue locomotives, alone with the drunkards beating their wings against the walls.</p>
      <p class="para">Then we were suddenly distracted by the rumbling of huge double decker trams that went leaping by,
        streaked with light like the villages celebrating their festivals, which the Po in flood suddenly knocks down
        and uproots, and, in the rapids and eddies of a deluge, drags down to the sea.</p>
      <p class="para">Then the silence increased. As we listened to the last faint prayer of the old canal and the
        crumbling of the bones of the moribund palaces with their green growth of beard, suddenly the hungry automobiles
        roared beneath our windows.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">`Come, my friends!' I said
      </h3>
      <p class="para">`Let us go! to last Mythology and the mystic cult of the ideal have been left behind. We are going
        to be present at the birth of the centaur and we shall soon see the first angels fly!<em>
          We must break down the gates of life to test the bolts and the padlocks! Let us go! Here is they very first
          sunrise on earth!</em>
        Nothing equals the splendor of its red sword which strikes for the first time in our millennial darkness.'</p>
      <p class="para">We went up to the three snorting machines to caress their breasts. I lay along mine like a corpse
        on its bier, but I suddenly revived again beneath the steering wheel - a guillotine knife - which threatened my
        stomach. A great sweep of madness brought us sharply back to ourselves and drove us through the streets, steep
        and deep, like dried up torrents. Here and there unhappy lamps in the windows taught us to despise our
        mathematical eyes.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">
        `Smell,' I exclaimed, `smell is good enough for wild beasts!'</h3>
      <p class="para">And we hunted, like young lions, death with its black fur dappled with pale crosses, who ran
        before us in the vast violet sky, palpable and living. And yet we had no ideal Mistress stretching her form up
        to the clouds, nor yet a cruel Queen to whom to offer our corpses twisted into the shape of Byzantine rings! No
        reason to die unless it is the desire to be rid of the too great weight of our courage!</p>
      <p class="para">We drove on, crushing beneath our burning wheels, like shirt-collars under the iron, the watch
        dogs on the steps of the houses. Death, tamed, went in front of me at each corner offering me his hand nicely,
        and sometimes lay on the ground with a noise of creaking jaws giving me velvet glances from the bottom of
        puddles.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">`Let us leave good sense behind like a hideous husk and let us hurl ourselves, like fruit spiced
        with pride, into the immense mouth and breast of the world! Let us feed the unknown, not from despair, but
        simply to enrich the unfathomable reservoirs of the Absurd!'</h3>
      <p class="para">As soon as I had said these words, I turned sharply back on my tracks with the mad intoxication of
        puppies biting their tails, and suddenly there were two cyclists disapproving of me and tottering in front of me
        like two persuasive but contradictory reasons. Their stupid swaying got in my way. What a bore! Pouah! I stopped
        short, and in disgust hurled myself - vlan! - head over heels in a ditch.</p>
      <p class="para">
        <em>Oh, maternal ditch, half full of muddy water! A factory gutter!</em>
        I savored a mouthful of strengthening muck which recalled the black teat of my Sudanese nurse! As I raised my
        body, mud-spattered and smelly, I felt the red hot poker of joy deliciously pierce my heart. A crowd of
        fishermen and gouty naturalists crowded terrified around this marvel. With patient and tentative care they
        raised high enormous grappling irons to fish up my car, like a vast shark that had run aground. It rose slowly
        leaving in the ditch, like scales, its heavy coachwork of good sense and its upholstery of comfort.
      </p>
      <p class="para">We thought it was dead, my good shark, but I woke it with a single caress of its powerful back,
        and it was revived running as fast as it could on its fins. Then with my face covered in good factory mud,
        covered with metal scratches, useless sweat and celestial grime, amidst the complaint of staid fishermen and
        angry naturalists, we dictated our first will and testament to all the living men on earth.</p>

      steamers sniffing the horizon; great-breasted locomotives, puffing on the rails like enormous steel horses with
      long tubes for bridle, and the gliding flight of aeroplanes whose propeller sounds like the flapping of a flag and
      the applause of enthusiastic crowds.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">It is in Italy that we are issuing this manifesto of ruinous and incendiary violence, by which we
        today are founding Futurism, because we want to deliver Italy from its gangrene of professors, archaeologists,
        tourist guides and antiquaries.
      </h3>
      <h3 class="h3">Italy has been too long the great second-hand market. We want to get rid of the innumerable museums
        which cover it with innumerable cemeteries.
      </h3>
      <p class="para"> Museums, cemeteries! Truly identical in their sinister juxtaposition of bodies that do not know
        each other. Public dormitories where you sleep side by side for ever with beings you hate or do not know.
        Reciprocal ferocity of the painters and sculptors who murder each other in the same museum with blows of line
        and color. To make a visit once a year, as one goes to see the graves of our dead once a year, that we could
        allow! We can even imagine placing flowers once a year at the feet of the Gioconda! But to take our sadness, our
        fragile courage and our anxiety to the museum every day, that we cannot admit! <em> Do you want to poison
          yourselves? Do you want to rot? </em> </p>
      <p class="para">To admire an old picture is to pour our sensibility into a funeral urn instead of casting it
        forward with violent spurts of creation and action. Do you want to waste the best part of your strength in a
        useless admiration of the past, from which you will emerge exhausted, diminished, trampled on?</p>
      <p class="para">Indeed daily visits to museums, libraries and academies (those cemeteries of wasted effort,
        calvaries of crucified dreams, registers of false starts!) is for artists what prolonged supervision by the
        parents is for intelligent young men, drunk with their own talent and ambition.</p>
      <p class="para"> For the dying, for invalids and for prisoners it may be all right. It is, perhaps, some sort of
        balm for their wounds, the admirable past, at a moment when the future is denied them. </p>
      <h3 class="h3"> But we will have none of it, we, the young, strong and living Futurists! </h3>
      <p class="para"> Let the good incendiaries with charred fingers come! Here they are! Heap up the fire to the
        shelves of the libraries! Divert the canals to flood the cellars of the museums! Let the glorious canvases swim
        ashore! Take the picks and hammers! Undermine the foundation of venerable towns!</p>
      <p class="para"> The oldest among us are not yet thirty years old: we have therefore at least ten years to
        accomplish our task. When we are forty let younger and stronger men than we throw us in the waste paper basket
        like useless manuscripts! They will come against us from afar, leaping on the light cadence of their first
        poems, clutching the air with their predatory fingers and sniffing at the gates of the academies the good scent
        of our decaying spirits, already promised to the catacombs of the libraries.</p>
      <p class="para">But we shall not be there. They will find us at last one winter's night in the depths of the
        country in a sad hangar echoing with the notes of the monotonous rain, crouched near our trembling aeroplanes,
        warming our hands at the wretched fire which our books of today will make when they flame gaily beneath the
        glittering flight of their pictures.</p>
      <p class="para">They will crowd around us, panting with anguish and disappointment, and exasperated by our proud
        indefatigable courage, will hurl themselves forward to kill us, with all the more hatred as their hearts will be
        drunk with love and admiration for us. And strong healthy Injustice will shine radiantly from their eyes. For
        art can only be violence, cruelty, injustice.</p>
      <p class="para">The oldest among us are not yet thirty, and yet we have already wasted treasures, treasures of
        strength, love, courage and keen will, hastily, deliriously, without thinking, with all our might, till we are
        out of breath. Look at us! We are not out of breath, our hearts are not in the least tired. For they are
        nourished by fire, hatred and speed! <em> Does this surprise you?</em> it is because you do not even remember
        being alive! Standing on the world's summit, we launch once more our challenge to the stars!</p>
      <p class="para">Your objections? All right! I know them! Of course! We know just what our beautiful false
        intelligence affirms: `We are only the sum and the prolongation of our ancestors,' it says. Perhaps! All right!
        What does it matter?</p>
      <h3 class="h3"> we will not listen! Take care not to repeat those infamous words! Instead, lift up your head!
        Standing on the world's summit we launch once again our insolent challenge to the stars!</h3>

    <h1 class="reflection"> Reflection</h1>
    <p class="para">The futurist manifesto sheds light on Italy’s state in the 19th Century. Marinetti comes up with a
      philosophy called Futurism in order to help citizens of Italy (Futurists) to look beyond the past and embrace the
      future by celebrating new advances in the industry. The Manifesto so proposed encouraged futurists to fight the
      past - become aggressive and demand settlements via the means of war. The art movement flourished and was
      vocalized to the world using literature, art and crafts. </p>
    <p class="para">The aggressive nature of the movement also helped futurists free themselves from conservative institutions by means of expressing their aesthetics, political ideals and social views in the society. Though the movement seems to be aggressive in nature and won’t work for this day and age - as the concept of futurism directly correlates with Fasicm. Marinetti's writing did give hope and direction to uplift the state of the art - as art was no longer perceived as just an expression using visuals but rather held power to drive social and political change.</p>
